# Requirement Analysis in Software Development
The purpose of this repository is to explain the concept of requirement analysis in the software development cycle and to master the principles and methodologies of it.

## What is Requirement Analysis
Requirement analysis is a phase in the Software Development Life Cycle where the needs of stakeholders are gathered, analysed and documented. The main goal of requirement analysis is to understand what the system should do before any development or design work begins.

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
- It ensures that all stakeholders have a shared understanding of what the software should do. This helps to reduce contradictory or incomplete requirements which is a common cause of project failure.

- It also defines the boundaries of a project specifying what should and should not be included in a project. This helps to prevent project screep and budget overruns.

- Requirement analysis also allows project managers to accurately estimate the resources and cost needed to complete a project. This helps to avoid overestimating or underestimating the cost and effort required for it.


## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis
- Requirement Gathering
During this phase, information is collected from stakeholders to understand what they expect from the system. Techniques used include questionnaires, observations and interviews.

- Requirement Elicitation
Here, brainstorming sessions are conducted to generate ideas from the requirements gathered. This helps to clarify vague requirements.

- Requirement Documentation
The requirements gathered are organised and documented. This document serves as a reference point for all stakeholders.

- Requirement Analysis and Modeling
The requirements gathered are refined and reviewed to ensure they are complete and consistent. Requirements are also prioritised based on their importance or impact on the project. Usecases or ER diagrams may be created to represent the system behaviour and structure.

- Requirement Validation
Documented requirements are validated with stakeholders to confirm that they're accurate and feasible. This helps to ensure that the stakeholders needs are met.


## Types of Requirements
### Functional Requirements
This describes what the system should do. It focuses on what the user expects the system to do.

#### Functional Requirements for a Hotel Booking System
- It should allow hotel managers to manage hotel-related information via a portal.
- The system must allow customers to search and book hotels.
- The system must include a payment service integration for payments.
- The system must notify users of new events.

### Non-Functional Requirements
This defines how the system should perform and not what it does. It focuses on system performance and constraints.

#### Functional Requirements from a Hotel Booking System
- The system must handle high user traffic and allow scaling
- The system must provide fast search results using caching and replication to reduce response time.
- The system must support data archiving and manage large volumes of historical data.
